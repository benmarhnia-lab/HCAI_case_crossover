This R code processes PDD and EDD from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), information on requesting HCAI data can be found at: https://hcai.ca.gov/data/request-data/.
This code can be used to select outcomes of interest and apply a case crossover design with time-stratified controls for multiple years, resulting in a combined dataset of PDD and EDD.

Questions or feedback on the code can be directed to Caitlin Jones-Ngo, caj008@ucsd.edu
